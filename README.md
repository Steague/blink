This is a simple project (more to be added later) that will cause all blink(1) mk2 devices connected to cycle though RGB colors.

## To install

```

## Note:

I use Windows primarily for home projects and this project requires Python 2.7.3 to be in the `PATH`. Please refer to the `node-blink1` npm project (found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-blink1)) for details about how to get this project working for you.
